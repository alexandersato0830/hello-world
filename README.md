# hello-world
This is a practice project to get myself familiar with github. Hello World!

I am a recent graduate from Webster University with a BS in CS. My primary language is C++, but right now I am exploring JavaScript. I love learning new programming languages and concepts. Regardless of how my job search goes, I am always practicing and improving myself. Github is the first step to me being able to share my projects with the world!
